# Score

Score is a single page web app created as part of the CodeClan 16 Week Software Development programme. The idea is that Score is an application for the administration of a sports news site allowing the user to create journalists, articles and administrate accordingly (sorts, page view counters and category filters). The app utilises a Java/Spring/Hibernate backend and a ReactJS front-end.
