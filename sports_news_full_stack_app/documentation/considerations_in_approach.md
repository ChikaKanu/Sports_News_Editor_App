## Planning & Documentation
### Considerations In Approach


#### Front-end - ReactJS

* Data should be retrieved from database URL specified by back end

* Front end should pass sort conditions through with respect to database fields

* List, Singular and Edit form views required

#### Intermediary Concerns

* Web address should connect front end to back end resource via api

#### Back-End - Java/Spring

* Back End should receive sort conditions and return objects in required order
* API required for Front End Access
* Functionality should be tested
